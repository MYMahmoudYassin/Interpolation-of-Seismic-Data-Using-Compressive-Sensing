# Interpolation-of-Seismic-Data-Using-Compressive-Sensing
1. compressiveSensingTest<br />
(implementation of compressive sensing theory on sinusoid signal)(use CVX for optimization)<br />
2. compressed_sensing_example_interpo1<br />
compressed sensing interpolation for Seismic data<br />
(missing data is random values not traces)
(We assume that the Seismic shot has a sparse representation in the<br />
DCT domain (not very sparse in practice -_-))
3. compressed_sensing_interpolation2<br />
(final version that perform interpolation using Copressive sensing and linear interpolation and <br />
comparing between them in terms of SNR)
4. LinearVsLinearCV<br />
( perform linear interpolation and new version which is linear interpolation and compressive sensing and comparing the results)<br />
