1-compressiveSensingTest
(implementation of compressive sensing theory on sinusoid signal)(use CVX for optimization)
2- compressed_sensing_example_interpo1
compressed sensing interpolation for Seismic data
(missing data is random values not traces)
(We assume that the Seismic shot has a sparse representation in the
DCT domain (not very sparse in practice -_-))
3- compressed_sensing_interpolation2
(final version that perform interpolation using Copressive sensing and linear interpolation and 
comparing between them in terms of SNR)
4- LinearVsLinearCV
( perform linear interpolation and new version which is linear interpolation and compressive sensing and comparing the results)
